This is the code that was used to scrape 8chan/pol data that was presented in
Baele, S., Brace, L., and Coan, T. (2020) "From Mass Shootings to “Sh**posting”: 
What Impact Did Far-right Attacks Have on the 8chan Forum?", which was 
published in the journal of Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism and Political Aggression.

There are two separate scraper files here, an 8chan scraper and an 8chan archived files
scraper. This is due to the way in which the research team scraped the 8chan/pol on a daily
basis, collecting both the text and image data from the board's posts. However, 8chan did archive
text data (but not image data) from old posts. As such, the latter scraper was used to collect
these archieved posts. 

Both files are Python files (.py) and should be good to run, with the exception of having to install
a couple of packages that you can see stated at the top of the scraper files.
